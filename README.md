# setup-polly-jest

## Overview

This helper provides a convenient way to use [PollyJS][] (HTTP recording,
replaying and stubbing tool) in your Jest/Jasmine tests.

## Installation

This library has a peer dependency on `@pollyjs/core`. That means that you will
need to install it separately if you don't have it installed yet.

```sh
npm install --save-dev setup-polly-jest @pollyjs/core
```

## Usage

This helper behaves almost the same way as built-in [Mocha][] or [QUnit][]
helpers for [PollyJS][]. If you used them before, this API should be familiar to
you:

```js
import { setupPolly } from 'setup-polly-jest';

describe('google.com', () => {
  let context = setupPolly({
    /* default configuration options */
  });

  test('should be able to search', async () => {
    /**
     * The `setupPolly` test helper creates a new polly instance which you can
     * access via `context.polly`. The recording name is generated based on
     * the suite (module) and spec (test) names.
     */
    context.polly.configure({ recordIfMissing: true });

    /* start: pseudo test code */

    await visit('/');

    await fillIn('#search', 'Awesome HTTP stubbing');

    await submit();

    expect(document.getElementById('search-result').textContent).toBe(
      'PollyJS'
    );

    /* end: pseudo test code */

    /**
     * The setupPolly test helper will call `context.polly.stop()` when your test
     * has finished.
     */
  });
});
```

To learn more about how to use PollyJS or what can you do with polly instance,
please refer to [PollyJS docs][polly-docs].

["Jest + Puppeteer"][jest-puppeteer] examples in PollyJS docs or
[tests](jest/index.test.js) in this repo

## Caveats

Although this library is thoroughly covered with unit and intergration tests,
its implementation depends upon overwriting Jasmine environment. That means that
some *major* changes in how Jest or Jasmine run tests can lead to this library not
working properly anymore.
